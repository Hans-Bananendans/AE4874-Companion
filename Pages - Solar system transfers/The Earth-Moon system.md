# The Earth-Moon system

> [!wip] ## ** !!! This section is still under construction !!! **
> The book is very poor at providing decent imagery of the various body oscillations (e.g. lunar libration, etc.). Lectures are better, but still not great. This section will probably need many images. The goal is to ensure that everyone who reads this section well will never confuse things like axial and nodal precession ever again.
