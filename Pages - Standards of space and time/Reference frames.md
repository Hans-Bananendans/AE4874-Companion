Book explanation is long-winded, not very visual, and generally takes a long time to get through for what understanding it provides. Lectures are much better, and so you can watch these as an alternative. 

Writing a summary for this section will take a lot of time (many pictures) for little time gain in understanding compared to the very good lectures, so **this is a low-priority section**.

 - [ ] Cross-reference this section with all concepts asked about in past exams.
