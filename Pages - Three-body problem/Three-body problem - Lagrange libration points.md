# Three-body problem - Lagrange libration points

> [!wip] ## ** !!! This section is still under construction !!! **

<!-- Wakker section 3.7 -->


## Sketch
To find Lagrange points, set partial derivatives of potential $U$ to zero.

All Lagrange points lie in $XY$-plane -> derive from analysis of $Z$-term in equations of motion (bracketed term cannot be zero, so dU/dz can only be zero if z=0)

Three points are on the $X$-axis.

Other two points are not, but still in $XY$-plane

Angle of L4 and L5 is 60 degrees with respect to $X$-axis.
