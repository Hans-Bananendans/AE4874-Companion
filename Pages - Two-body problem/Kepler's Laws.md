# Kepler's Laws

German astrodynamicist Johannes Kepler derived a number of very useful equations related to two-body motion, which he published in the early 1600s.
___

##### Kepler's first law
_"The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci."_

We will not go into a mathematical derivation of this. Unbeknownst to Kepler at the time, several other orbits shaped like [[Two-body problem - Conic sections|conic sections]] are possible, like the hyperbolic trajectory.
___

##### Kepler's second law
_"A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time."_

We now know that this is of course not only true for planets around the Sun, but valid for any restricted two-body problem. A derivation of Kepler's second law can be found [[Two-body problem - Conservation laws#Deriving Kepler's Second Law|here]].

___

##### Kepler's third law
_"The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit."_

In other words:
$$
T^2 \propto a^3
$$

Furthermore, for any satellite in an elliptical orbit, you can compute the orbital period as:
$$
T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\dfrac{a^3}{\mu}}
$$

A derivation of this law can be found [[Kepler's Third Law|here]].
