This page contains a summary of many of the properties of the two-body problem. At its base lie two images found in an old Astrodynamics summary of unknown author (if anyone knows the author, let me know so I can properly credit him/her). This summary contains a very nice visual roadmap of how to navigate problems that deal with two-body systems.

For now, these images are presented as-is, with little context or commentary.
