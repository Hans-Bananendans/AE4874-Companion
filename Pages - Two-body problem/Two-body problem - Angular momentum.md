# Angular momentum in the two-body problem
<!-- [Wakker] section 2.7 -->

> [!wip] ## ** !!! This section is still under construction !!! **

The two-body problem is interesting in part because it displays interesting symmetries. In this section, we look at the angular momentum of a two-body system.

Let's consider two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ interacting with one another under gravity. This forms a two-body system. Instead of using the inertial reference frame $XY$ to describe the position of these masses, let's put another reference frame $X'Y'$ at the barycentre. We know that the barycentre moves with some constant velocity with respect to the origin of $XY$, so $X'Y'$ is also an **inertial** reference frame.

$$\bar{r}_{CM} = \dfrac{\sum_{j=1}^n m_j \bar{r}_j}{\sum_{j=1}^n m_j} = \bar{0}$$
