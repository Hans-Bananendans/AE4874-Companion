# Two-body problem - Conic sections

In the restricted two-body problem, we consider how two masses, one much more massive than the other, move with respect to one another. The relative motion that results can be subdivided in a number of different types, and we will explore that further in this section.

The first type of motion that can result is simply a rectilinear motion of the two bodies towards one another, resulting in a collision. This is a motion we are not often interested in, so we won't discuss it in detail. Beyond that, there are four important motions that we will look at, all of which are **conic sections**:

This family of shapes may look familiar from your past adventures in calculus. All four are related to each other, but each one has its own properties and quirks. The circular trajectory is really a special case of the elliptical trajectory. The parabolic trajectory resembles the hyperbolic trajectory in many ways, but differs in important other ways, such as the lack of asymptotes and its behaviour at infinity.

The [[Wakker]] book has three separate chapters on these orbit types; circular and elliptical trajectories are discussed together, and parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories each get their own chapter. This companion will follow a similar approach. I recommend that you start with the circular/elliptical orbits, so you can get familiar with the mathematics involved, and then learn how the other trajectories differ.
