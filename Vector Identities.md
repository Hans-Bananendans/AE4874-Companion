# Vector Identities

This is a list of vector identities that are commonly used in this summary. It is put here for easy reference, and to save you time looking these up every time you need them.
___
### Vector identity 1:
$$\bar{r} \cdot \bar{r} = r^2$$
___
### Vector identity 2:
$$\bar{r} \cdot \dot{\bar{r}} = r  \dot{r}$$
___
### Vector identity 3:
$$\bar{r} \cdot \ddot{\bar{r}} = r  \ddot{r}$$
___
### Vector identity 4:
$$\bar{a} \cdot (\bar{a} \times \bar{b}) = 0 $$
___
### Vector identity 5:
$$\bar{a} \cdot (\bar{b} \times \bar{c}) = (\bar{a} \times \bar{b}) \cdot \bar{c} $$
___
### Vector identity 6:
$$\bar{a} \times (\bar{b} \times \bar{c}) = \bar{b} (\bar{a} \cdot \bar{c}) - \bar{c} (\bar{a} \cdot \bar{b}) $$
