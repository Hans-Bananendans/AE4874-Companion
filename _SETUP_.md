# Astrodynamics Summary setup:
Goals:
1. Intimately get to know the theoretical material in the process of making it
2. Set up a knowledge repository for Astrodynamics as a place to return to
3. Act as a supplementary study aid for other students.

Ingredients:
Summary of topics (arranged by topics? Wakker sections?)
Checklist of topics whilst working on it
Supplementary math derivations
Good assumption management
New/clearer graphics where needed?
Worked out exercises/old exam questions
Exam content guide/checklist
Coding examples
Link to lecture videos
formula sheet
